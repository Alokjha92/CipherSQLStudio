CipherSQLStudio

CipherSQLStudio is a browser-based SQL learning platform designed for students to practice SQL queries against pre-configured assignments with real-time feedback and intelligent hints. This project was developed as part of the Full Stack Developer Internship assignment at CipherSchools.

Project Overview

In modern education, practicing SQL queries interactively helps students understand database concepts quickly. CipherSQLStudio provides a hands-on environment where users can:

View and select SQL assignments with varying difficulty levels.

Write and execute SQL queries in a browser-based code editor (Monaco Editor).

Get intelligent hints powered by an LLM to guide learning without revealing full solutions.

See query results in real-time for instant feedback.

The platform does not require students to create databases; assignments and sample data are pre-configured in the backend.
